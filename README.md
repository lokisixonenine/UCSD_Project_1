## User Story:
If you're lucky enough to be multilingual and can speak several languages fluently, you know how much more meaningful your interactions with different cultural situations can be and you know how much more being able to communicate can enhance your experience.

Our app gives you a fun way to learn several select fantasy languages so that you can fully immerse yourself at the next pop culture convention or geeky meet-up you find yourself at.  Currently, our app is a one-way translator. This initial offering gives you a starting point with which to start learning a language only a select few geeky people may know. By infusing fun into learning, we hope to encourage our users to come back and learn actual languages from us in future iterations of our app.
